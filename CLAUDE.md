## Architecture Overview

This is a Japanese-language AI-powered task management application built with Next.js 15 App Router. The application combines traditional task management with AI-driven work estimation and automatic weekly schedule generation.

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI based)
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (local file storage)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 API with intelligent fallback
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (97 comprehensive tests)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (automated testing, linting, security scanning)

### High-Level Architecture

#### Three-Layer Architecture
1. **Presentation Layer** (`src/components/`, `src/app/`)
   - React components with TypeScript
   - Next.js App Router for routing and layouts
   - shadcn/ui components for consistent UI

2. **Business Logic Layer** (`src/lib/services/`)
   - `TaskService`: Task CRUD operations and scheduling logic
   - `AIService`: OpenAI integration with fallback mechanisms

3. **Data Access Layer** (`src/lib/database/`)
   - SQLite database with prepared statements
   - Lazy initialization pattern for database connections
   - Three main tables: tasks, task_schedules, ai_estimates

#### Key Components
- **TaskManager**: Main orchestrating component with tab navigation (tasks vs schedule view)
- **TaskForm**: Handles task creation/editing with integrated AI estimation
- **WeeklySchedule**: Calendar visualization with automatic task allocation

#### Database Schema
```sql
tasks: id, title, description, priority ('must'|'want'), category, estimated_hours, status, timestamps
task_schedules: task_id, day_of_week (1-5), start_time, end_time, scheduled_date
ai_estimates: task_id, estimated_hours, confidence_score, reasoning, questions_asked
```

#### API Routes Structure
- `/api/tasks` - Task CRUD operations
- `/api/tasks/[id]` - Individual task operations  
- `/api/estimate` - AI-powered work estimation
- `/api/schedule` - Weekly schedule management
- `/api/schedule/generate` - Automatic schedule generation

### Key Patterns and Conventions

#### Database Patterns
- **Lazy initialization**: Database connections are created only when needed
- **Prepared statements**: All database queries use prepared statements through getter methods
- **Graceful handling**: Database operations include proper error handling and logging

#### AI Integration Patterns
- **Fallback strategy**: OpenAI API failures gracefully fall back to mock estimation logic
- **Structured prompts**: AI prompts are designed for JSON responses with specific schemas
- **Error boundaries**: AI operations are wrapped in try-catch with user-friendly error messages

#### Form Handling
- **Zod validation**: All forms use Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- **React Hook Form**: Consistent form state management across components
- **Real-time feedback**: AI estimation integrates seamlessly into form workflow

#### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom CSS variables
- **Design system**: shadcn/ui components provide consistent design patterns
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Japanese localization**: All UI text is in Japanese

### Development Guidelines

#### Working with the Database
- Database initialization happens automatically on first access
- Use the `TaskService` class methods rather than direct database access
- The database file is created in `data/tasks.db` and should be gitignored

#### AI Integration
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` for full AI functionality
- Mock estimation works without API key for development
- AI responses are parsed as JSON with fallback error handling

#### Adding New Features
- Follow the three-layer architecture (UI → Service → Database)
- Add new API routes under `/api/` following REST conventions
- Use TypeScript interfaces from `src/lib/types.ts`
- Maintain the Japanese language interface

#### Component Development
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Follow the existing prop patterns and TypeScript interfaces
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Include proper error states and loading indicators

### Environment Setup

#### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional - enables full AI functionality
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

#### Database Setup
- SQLite database auto-initializes on first run
- Database file: `data/tasks.db` (created automatically)
- Schema is applied automatically from `src/lib/database/schema.sql`

### Testing the Application

#### Automated Testing Suite
The application includes a comprehensive test suite with 97 tests covering:

- **API Endpoint Tests** (`src/__tests__/api/`)
  - `/api/tasks` CRUD operations
  - `/api/estimate` AI estimation functionality
  - Error handling and edge cases

- **Service Layer Tests** (`src/__tests__/services/`)
  - `TaskService` business logic and database operations
  - `AIService` OpenAI integration and fallback mechanisms
  - Edge cases and error scenarios

- **Component Tests** (`src/__tests__/components/`)
  - `TaskManager` orchestration and tab navigation
  - `TaskForm` form validation and AI integration
  - `WeeklySchedule` calendar visualization and scheduling

#### Test Configuration
- **Framework**: Jest with Next.js integration
- **Environment**: jsdom for component tests, node for API tests
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage reporting with lcov format
- **Mocking**: Service-level mocking strategy for reliable tests

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Run in CI mode (used by GitHub Actions)
npm run test:ci
```

#### Manual Testing Workflow
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test task creation with and without AI estimation
3. Generate weekly schedule to verify algorithm
4. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
5. Verify database persistence across restarts

#### Key Test Scenarios
- Task CRUD operations
- AI estimation (with and without OpenAI API)
- Schedule generation with various task combinations
- Form validation and error handling
- Mobile responsive behavior

### CI/CD Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - Automated testing on Node.js 20.x
  - ESLint and TypeScript checking
  - Build verification
  - Coverage reporting to Codecov

- **Security Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
  - npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
  - CodeQL static analysis for security issues
  - Weekly scheduled security scans

- **Docker Workflow** (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`)
  - Docker image building and testing
  - Container registry publishing (on main branch)

#### Dependency Management
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
  - Weekly automated dependency updates
  - Separate handling for npm and Docker dependencies
  - Automatic PR creation with proper labeling

#### Quality Gates
Before any code reaches production:
1. All tests must pass
2. ESLint checks must pass
3. TypeScript compilation must succeed
4. Build process must complete successfully
5. Security scans must pass

#### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run `npm run lint && npm run test:ci && npm run build`
4. Create Pull Request
5. CI pipeline runs automatically
6. Code review and approval
7. Merge to main triggers deployment pipeline
